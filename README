****** HEXUP ******

**** An implementation of XQuery Update Facility in Haskell ****
This project was performed by students Lukas Niessen and Per Andersson as part
of the course Frontiers of Programming Language Technology given at Chalmers
University of Technology, during the academic year 2007/2008.

*** Motivation ***
XML is a widely used format to represent data. XQuery is a standard that
enables querys similar to those of relational databases for XML. XQuery only
supports selection from XML documents, XQuery Update Facility enables
techniques for modifying existing XML documents.

*** HEXUP ***
HEXUP is an Haskell implementation of XQuery Update Facility that uses the
tools Parsec, for parsing the queries, and HXT, Haskell XML Toolbox, for
interacting with XML documents.
